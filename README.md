## About

This an altered version of the great **HaE Burp Extension** based on version 2.4.6.

Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gh0stkey">EvilChen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/0chencc">0chencc</a> for the original version https://github.com/gh0stkey/HaE

The Portswigger version can be found on https://github.com/portswigger/highlighter-and-extractor

## What's Different

This is a great Burp extensions, but there were a few things I wanted to change, so I forked the original. Here's what's different:

- Add `none` option for highlight
- Default a new rule to `none`
- Show comments split with `|` instead of `,` to make it easier to read
- Only search and highlight `In Scope` requests and responses
- Add more file extension exclusions
- Add a config option for **Hghlight Method**. The original does colour upscaling, which means that if a number of matches are found for one request/response, the colour can end up being upscaled and shown as colour of increased severity. I personally preferred to have a highlight of the most severe finding only (this allows a request/response not to be highlighted at all, even if there ar 5 `none` rules fired).

## Excuses

I'm not a Java programmer and I don't understand creating a proper UI, so the new Highlight Method option on the config tab is not aligned properly... but who cares?!

## Notes

- If you want to use regex with special characters like `\n`, `\s`, etc. then you need to use engine `nfa`
- Case sensitive only works for engine `nfa`, therefore if you use `dfa` you need to make sure you deal with different cases.
- Apparently `dfa` is faster than `nfa`
- You can search `Databoard` with `*.` (I;m not sure this change was in the Portswigger version).
- You need to wrap the regex of rules in `()` to work correctly.
- Apparently `dfa` is faster than `nfa`
- Disable any rules that you don't need or want as they can slow thing down.

Feel free to use this version too!

Good luck and good hunting!
